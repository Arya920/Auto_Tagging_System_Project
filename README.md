The objective of this project is to build a model to automatically predict tags for a given a StackExchange question by using the text of the question & the tags.

- Dataset:Over 85,000 questions and over 1300 unique tags

### Description
The question-answering site StackOverflow allows users to assign tags to questions in order to make them easier for other people to find. Further experts on a certain topic can subscribe to tags to receive digests of new questions for which they might have an answer. Therefore it is both in the interest of the original poster and in the interest of people who are interested in the answer that a question gets assigned appropriate tags.
